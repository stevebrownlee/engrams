uvx --from git+https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/context-portal.git@v0.3.8 engrams-mcp --mode stdio
```

## v0.3.7 (2025-10-30)

### Critical Fix
- **Resolved FastAPI/Starlette Dependency Conflict:** Fixed a dependency conflict that was preventing uvx installation. The issue occurred because `fastapi==0.116.2` required `starlette<0.49.0`, while we needed `starlette>=0.49.1` for the CVE-2025-62727 security fix.

### Changes
- **Updated FastAPI:** Upgraded from `0.116.2` to `>=0.119.1`, which natively supports Starlette 0.49.1+
- **Removed Explicit Starlette Dependency:** No longer needed as FastAPI 0.119.1+ automatically includes the secure version of Starlette
- **Maintained Security Posture:** The update preserves all security fixes including CVE-2025-62727 (Starlette), CVE-2025-50181, and CVE-2025-50182 (urllib3)

### Installation
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/context-portal.git engrams-mcp --mode stdio
```

Or via pip:
```bash
pip install context-portal-mcp
```

<br>

## v0.3.6 (2025-10-28)

### Security
- Updated **starlette** to `>=0.49.1` to remediate CVE-2025-62727 (High severity - O(n^2) DoS vulnerability in Range header merging in `starlette.responses.FileResponse`).
- Updated **urllib3** to `>=2.5.0` to remediate CVE-2025-50181 and CVE-2025-50182 (Moderate severity).

### Packaging
- Updated project version to `0.3.6` in `pyproject.toml`.
- Added explicit `urllib3>=2.5.0` dependency to both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`.

<br>

## v0.3.5 (2025-10-22)

### Security
- Bumped Authlib to `~=1.6.5` to remediate CVE-2025-61920 (High) and GHSA-g7f3-828f-7h7m (Moderate).
- Regenerated `uv.lock` to pin `authlib==1.6.5` and align with current dependencies.
- Verified via full test run: 15 passed, 0 failed.

### Packaging
- Updated project version to `0.3.5` in `pyproject.toml`.
- Ensured `authlib` is declared in `pyproject.toml` dependencies to keep locks and installs consistent across environments.

## v0.3.4 (2025-09-18)

### Critical Bug Fix
- **String-to-Integer Coercion:** Fixed a validation timing issue where field-level `ge`/`le` constraints in FastMCP tool definitions were preventing string-to-integer coercion from working properly. String parameters like `"5"` for `limit` were being rejected before the `IntCoercionMixin` could convert them to integers. The fix removes field-level constraints from 13 affected tools and replaces them with `@model_validator(mode='after')` methods in Pydantic models, ensuring coercion happens before validation.

### Technical Details
### Security
- Dependency hardening: Pin Authlib to `~=1.6.5` to address CVE-2025-61920 (High) and GHSA-g7f3-828f-7h7m (Moderate). Regenerated `uv.lock` to ensure 1.6.5 is locked. No runtime regressions observed (15/15 tests passing).
- **Affected Tools:** `get_decisions`, `get_progress`, `get_system_patterns`, `get_custom_data`, `search_decisions_fts`, `search_custom_data_value_fts`, `search_project_glossary_fts`, `get_recent_activity_summary`, `semantic_search_engrams`, `get_item_history`, `batch_log_items`, `delete_decision_by_id`, `delete_system_pattern_by_id`
- **Root Cause:** FastMCP field-level `ge=1` and `le=25` constraints were applied before Pydantic model validation, preventing the custom `IntCoercionMixin` from converting string inputs to integers
- **Solution:** Moved all integer validation logic to `@model_validator(mode='after')` methods that run after field coercion

<br>

## v0.3.3 (2025-09-18)

### Fixes & Improvements
- **Pydantic Validation Fix:** Corrected an issue where Pydantic's `ge=1` constraint was being applied before the `IntCoercionMixin` could convert string-based integers, causing validation errors. The fix ensures that string-to-integer coercion happens before validation, allowing for more flexible input.
- Timezone-aware datetimes: replaced naive UTC usage with aware UTC across models and DB code, and registered SQLite adapters/converters for reliable UTC round-tripping. Files: [src/context_portal_mcp/db/models.py](src/context_portal_mcp/db/models.py), [src/context_portal_mcp/db/database.py](src/context_portal_mcp/db/database.py).
- Integer-like string inputs: added lenient parsing that coerces digit-only strings to integers before validation in relevant argument models. Credit: @cipradu.
- Dependency security: addressed Starlette advisory GHSA-2c2j-9gv5-cj73 by upgrading FastAPI to 0.116.2 and constraining Starlette to >=0.47.2,<0.49.0; verified via pip-audit: "No known vulnerabilities found."

<br>

## v0.3.0 (2025-09-08)

### Features
* **Universal Workspace Auto-Detection:** Integrated multi-strategy workspace discovery (strong indicators, multiple indicators, existing `context_portal/`, environment variables, fallback). Eliminates need to hardcode `--workspace_id` in most MCP client configs. Includes new CLI flags: `--auto-detect-workspace` (default enabled), `--no-auto-detect`, and `--workspace-search-start <path>`.
* **Diagnostic Tool:** Added `get_workspace_detection_info` MCP tool to expose detection details for debugging ambiguous setups.
* **Graceful `${workspaceFolder}` Handling:** If an IDE passes the literal `${workspaceFolder}`, the server now warns and safely auto-detects instead of initializing incorrectly.
* **Documentation:** Added `UNIVERSAL_WORKSPACE_DETECTION.md` plus README section “Automatic Workspace Detection” with usage guidance and examples.

### Notes
This release supersedes the stalled external contribution (original PR #60). Attribution preserved in commit metadata. Users are encouraged to remove hardcoded absolute paths where safe.

### Upgrade Guidance
No migration steps required. Existing workflows with explicit `--workspace_id` continue to function. To leverage auto-detection, you may remove the flag (or allow per-call workspace_id injection).

<br>

## v0.2.23 (2025-08-30)

### Features

<br>

## v0.2.22 (2025-07-27)

### Bug Fixes
*   **Startup Timeout:** Resolved a client-side timeout issue by pre-warming the database connection on server startup. This ensures the server is fully initialized before accepting connections, preventing timeouts on the first tool call.

<br>

## v0.2.21 (2025-07-24)

### Features & Fixes
*   **Deferred Workspace Initialization:** The server now initializes the workspace and database on the first tool call rather than on startup. This resolves a critical issue where an invalid or un-expanded `${workspaceFolder}` variable from the client would prevent the server from starting. (Credit: @yy1588133)
*   **Full-Text Search (FTS):** Introduced FTS5 virtual tables for `decisions` and `custom_data`. This significantly enhances search capabilities within Engrams. (Credit: @yy1588133)
*   **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Added a new test script (`test_engrams_tools.py`) to validate all Engrams MCP tools, improving stability and reliability. (Credit: @yy1588133)

<br>

## v0.2.20 (2025-07-23)

### Bug Fixes
Applied a fix to resolve the intermittent connection issue with the Engrams MCP server. A 500ms delay has been added to the startup sequence in src/context_portal_mcp/main.py to prevent a race condition. 

<br>

## v0.2.19 (2025-07-09)

### Bug Fixes
*   **Pydantic Validation:** Corrected a type coercion issue where Pydantic's `gt=0` constraint for integer fields would fail when receiving numbers from the JSON-based MCP protocol. The validation has been updated to the more robust `ge=1` (greater than or equal to 1) to ensure compatibility. (Credit: @akeech-chatham)

<br>

## Version 0.2.18 - Hotfix for Log File Path Resolution

This release provides a hotfix to ensure the log file path is correctly resolved relative to the `context_portal` directory within the workspace, even when overridden by client-provided relative paths.

**Key Fix:**

- **Log Path Resolution:** The logging setup logic in `main.py` has been improved to robustly join the `workspace_id`, the `context_portal` directory, and any relative log file path. This corrects an issue where client-provided relative paths (e.g., `./logs/engrams.log`) were incorrectly resolved from the workspace root instead of from within the `context_portal` directory.

**Impact:**

This fix ensures that logs are always created in the intended `context_portal/logs/` directory, improving consistency and organization.

<br>

## Version 0.2.17 - Log File Path Standardization

This release changes the default location for the server's log file to a more standardized and predictable path within the workspace.

**Key Change:**

- **Default Log Path:** The `--log-file` argument now defaults to `context_portal/logs/engrams.log`. The server will automatically create this directory structure within the active workspace if it doesn't exist. This keeps project-related files, including logs, neatly organized inside the `context_portal` directory.

**Impact:**

This change improves project organization by preventing log files from cluttering the root of the workspace.

<br>

## Version 0.2.16 - IDE Compatibility Fix

This hotfix release addresses a critical startup failure when using the Engrams server with the latest versions of client IDEs (e.g., Roo Code v3.20.0 and later).

**Key Fix:**

- **Logging System Refactor:** The server's logging system has been refactored to prevent premature interaction with `stdio` streams. All logging is now configured *after* command-line arguments are parsed, resolving the `OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument` and `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file` errors that occurred during startup in `stdio` mode.

**Impact:**

This is a critical update for all users to ensure compatibility with the latest development tools. The server should now start and run reliably when launched from any IDE.

<br>

## Version 0.2.14 - Database Stability and Bug Fixes

This release addresses a series of critical bugs related to database initialization and Alembic migrations, significantly improving the stability and reliability of the Engrams server.

**Key Fixes:**

- **Database Initialization:** Resolved a critical failure where new workspaces would fail to initialize the database due to a `no such column: timestamp` error. The root cause was a complex series of issues with Alembic migrations, which have now been fully repaired.
- **Alembic Migration History:** Repaired a corrupted Alembic migration history that was causing "Multiple head revisions are present" errors and preventing all database operations. The migration history is now clean and linear.
- **`get_system_patterns` Tool:** Fixed a bug where using the `limit` parameter would cause a Pydantic validation error. The tool now correctly handles the `limit` parameter.

**Impact:**

This is a critical stability release. All users should upgrade to ensure reliable database operation and to benefit from the bug fixes.

<br>

## Version 0.2.11 - Cursor Initialization Hotfix

This release addresses a critical bug that caused `NameError: name 'cursor' is not defined` during database operations.

**Key Fix:**

- **Cursor Initialization Fix:** Corrected `src/context_portal_mcp/db/database.py` to ensure the `cursor` variable is always initialized before use within database functions. This resolves the `NameError` and ensures robust database interactions.

**Impact:**

This is a critical fix for server stability, ensuring all database operations function correctly.

<br>

## Version 0.2.10 - Pydantic Model Hotfix

This release addresses a critical bug that caused MCP connection failures on Windows due to improper path escaping in the generated tool schema.

**Key Fix:**

- **Pydantic Model Default Fix:** Modified `src/context_portal_mcp/db/models.py` to add `default=None` to optional path arguments in the `ExportConportToMarkdownArgs` and `ImportMarkdownToConportArgs` models. This prevents Pydantic from generating default path values that contain unescaped backslashes on Windows, resolving the `SyntaxError: Bad escaped character in JSON` error during server startup.

**Impact:**

This is a critical fix for Windows users, ensuring the Engrams MCP server can start and run reliably.

<br>

## Version 0.2.9 - Path Escaping Hotfix

This release addresses a critical bug that caused MCP connection failures on Windows due to improper path escaping.

**Key Fix:**

- **JSON Escape Character Fix:** Modified `src/context_portal_mcp/db/database.py` to use `.as_posix()` when constructing file paths for Alembic. This ensures that all paths use forward slashes, preventing `SyntaxError: Bad escaped character in JSON` errors when the server communicates with the client on Windows.

**Impact:**

This is a critical fix for Windows users, ensuring the Engrams MCP server can start and run reliably.

<br>

## Version 0.2.8 - Alembic, Encoding, and Usability Enhancements

This release introduces several key improvements, including a fix for Alembic migrations, enhanced UTF-8 encoding for file operations, and a streamlined installation process.

**Key Fixes & Enhancements:**

- **Alembic Migration Fix:** Resolved a bug that caused import failures for `system_patterns.md` due to a missing `timestamp` column in the database schema. A new Alembic migration script has been added to correctly add this column, ensuring data integrity and successful imports.
- **UTF-8 Encoding:** All file read/write operations during data import and export now explicitly use `encoding="utf-8"`. This prevents encoding errors and ensures cross-platform compatibility.
- **Streamlined Installation:** The `README.md` has been updated to feature `uvx` as the primary and recommended method for running the Engrams server. This simplifies the setup process for new users. A special thanks to contributor [elasticdotventures](https://github.com/elasticdotventures) for their work on the `uvx` configuration.
- **Automated Alembic Provisioning:** The Engrams server now automatically ensures that the necessary `alembic.ini` and `alembic/` directory are present in the workspace root at startup, copying them from internal templates if they are missing.
- **Runtime Error Fix:** Corrected an `IndentationError` in `main.py` that occurred during server startup.

**Impact:**

This release improves the robustness and reliability of Engrams's database migrations and data handling. The updated documentation and automated Alembic provisioning make the server easier to set up and use, while the encoding fix ensures that data is handled consistently across different environments.

<br>

## Version 0.2.6 - Bug Fix Release

This release addresses a critical issue with Alembic database migrations that could occur when initializing Engrams in environments where a `context.db` file already existed, but without proper Alembic version tracking.

**Key Fix:**
- Modified the initial Alembic migration script (`068b7234d6a7_initial_database_schema.py`) to use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for the `product_context` and `active_context` tables. This prevents `sqlite3.OperationalError` when the tables are already present, ensuring smoother initialization and operation of the Engrams server.

**Impact:**
This fix improves the robustness of Engrams's database initialization process, particularly in scenarios involving partial or pre-existing database setups.

<br>

## Engrams v0.2.4 Update Notes

This release focuses on significant stability improvements, particularly around database management and migration, alongside enhanced data import capabilities.

### Key Changes and Bug Fixes:

#### 1. Robust Database Initialization and Migration (Alembic)
*   **Problem:** Persistent `alembic` migration failures, including `"No 'script_location' key found in configuration"` and `Can't locate revision` errors, which led to an inconsistent database state.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Refactored `src/context_portal_mcp/db/database.py` to ensure robust Alembic pathing and programmatic configuration of `script_location` and `sqlalchemy.url`.
    *   Introduced `ensure_alembic_files_exist` to reliably provision `alembic.ini` and the `alembic/` directory in the workspace, copying them from internal templates if missing. This ensures a consistent and correct Alembic environment for each workspace.
    *   Integrated this provisioning into `src/context_portal_mcp/main.py`'s `stdio` mode startup, guaranteeing that the Alembic environment is set up on server launch.
    *   Implemented a clean migration strategy that involves deleting the `context.db`, `alembic.ini`, and the `alembic/` directory to force a fresh, consistent migration when critical revision errors occur.

#### 2. Resolved Database Operation Errors
*   **Problem:** Recurrent `NameError: name 'cursor' is not defined` exceptions during database operations (e.g., `get_product_context`, `log_custom_data`), which prevented proper data interaction.
*   **Solution:** Modified all relevant database functions in `src/context_portal_mcp/db/database.py` to correctly initialize `cursor = None` and ensure `cursor.close()` is only called if `cursor` was successfully assigned, making database interactions more robust.

#### 3. Timestamp Column Schema Consistency
*   **Problem:** Inconsistent schema for `timestamp` columns in `system_patterns` and `custom_data` tables, leading to import failures and `AttributeError` exceptions.
*   **Solution:** Verified and resolved discrepancies in the database schema, ensuring that `timestamp` columns are correctly present and accessible in both `system_patterns` and `custom_data` tables. This involved identifying and removing redundant migration attempts.

#### 4. Enhanced Data Import Capabilities
*   **Problem:** Need to import existing Engrams data from various backup sources into a newly provisioned or migrated database.
*   **Solution:** Successfully implemented a two-phase data import strategy using `import_markdown_to_engrams`, allowing for the consolidation of project data from multiple markdown export sources (e.g., `engrams-export/` and `engrams_migration_test_backup/`). This ensures that existing project context, decisions, progress, and custom data can be seamlessly integrated.

#### 5. General Stability and Reliability
*   Addressed various minor issues including `IndentationError`, `SyntaxError`, `pip.exe` missing from `uv venv`, incorrect `package-data` in `pyproject.toml`, ChromaDB `ValueError` for list metadata, and log file location issues.
*   Improved overall server startup and database connection handling.

### Upgrade Notes:
*   Users upgrading from previous versions are recommended to ensure their `alembic.ini` and `alembic/` directories in the workspace are correctly provisioned by starting the Engrams server. If issues persist, consider deleting `context.db`, `alembic.ini`, and the `alembic/` directory in your workspace to allow for a clean re-provisioning and migration.

- **Improved Logging:** Enhanced server-side logging for better visibility into operations and easier debugging.
- **ChromaDB Tag Handling:** Fixed a `ValueError` where list-type tags were incorrectly passed to ChromaDB's `upsert` function, ensuring robust vector store metadata handling.
- **`CustomData` Timestamp:** Added a `timestamp` field to the `CustomData` model, enabling better tracking and querying of custom data entries.
- **Initial Alembic Integration:** Introduced Alembic for automated database schema management. While the initial integration in this version might require manual steps for older databases, it lays the groundwork for seamless future upgrades.

## v0.1.9 - Initial Alembic Integration (2025-05-30)

This release marks the initial integration of Alembic for database schema management.

### New Features:
- **Alembic Database Migrations:** Engrams now uses Alembic to manage its `context.db` schema. This enables automated database upgrades when updating the `context-portal-mcp` package, designed to preserve existing data.

### Important Notes:
- For users upgrading from versions prior to `v0.1.9`, a manual data migration (export, delete `context.db`, import) might be necessary due to significant schema changes. Refer to the `UPDATE_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

## v0.1.8 - Enhanced Logging, Critical Fixes, and Improved Context Handling

This release brings significant improvements to the Engrams MCP server, focusing on enhanced observability, critical bug fixes, and more robust context management. Thanks @devxpain !!

### Key Changes:

*   **Fixed Vector Store Metadata Handling:** Resolved a `ValueError` that occurred when upserting embeddings with list-type tags (e.g., decision tags). Tags are now correctly converted to a scalar format before being sent to the vector store, ensuring proper semantic search functionality.
*   **New Logging Options:** Introduced `--log-file` and `--log-level` command-line arguments to `main.py`, allowing users to configure log output to a file with rotation and control the verbosity of server logs. This greatly enhances debugging and monitoring capabilities.
*   **Critical Connection Error Fix:** Removed a problematic internal assertion in `main.py` that was causing frequent "Connection closed" errors during development, particularly when the server attempted to create its database within its own installation directory. This improves server stability and developer experience.
*   **Updated Documentation:** Revised `README.md` to include consistent and accurate configuration examples for the new logging options across all installation types (PyPI and Git repository, including Windows examples).

### Changes made after v0.1.7:

*   **Vector Store Metadata Fix:** Specifically, the `ValueError` related to list-type tags in embeddings was addressed in `src/context_portal_mcp/handlers/mcp_handlers.py`.
*   **Integration of PR #14:** The new logging features and the critical connection error fix from PR #14 were merged into `main.py`.
*   **README.md Consistency:** The `README.md` was updated to ensure the Windows configuration examples for logging were consistent with other platforms.

<br>

## v0.1.7

Fixed the `export_engrams_to_markdown` tool so that it includes `current_focus` and `open_issues` fields, along with the existing `current_task`.

<br>

## v0.1.6

Fixed incorrect script entry point in pyproject.toml, updated to:
engrams-mcp = "context_portal_mcp.main:cli_entry_point"

Corrected the license reference in pyproject.toml to Apache 2.0

<br>

## v0.1.4

Added PyPi installation option

<br>

## v0.1.3

**Release Notes Summary: Semantic Search & Enhanced Data Intelligence**

This version introduces a powerful semantic search capability to Engrams, along with a more intelligent data backend:

*   **New Semantic Search Tool (`semantic_search_engrams`)**:
    *   Users can now search for Engrams items (Decisions, Progress, System Patterns, Custom Data, etc.) based on the semantic meaning of their query text, going beyond simple keyword matching.
    *   Supports advanced filtering by item type, tags (match all or any), and custom data categories to refine search results.

*   **Automatic Embedding Generation**:
    *   Key Engrams items (Decisions, Progress Entries, System Patterns, and text-based Custom Data) now automatically have embeddings generated and stored when they are logged.
    *   This powers the semantic search and enables future AI-driven insights.
    *   Utilizes the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for generating embeddings, ensuring consistency.

*   **Integrated Vector Store (ChromaDB)**:
    *   Embeddings are stored in a local ChromaDB vector database, managed per workspace within the `.engrams_vector_data` directory.
    *   The system now explicitly configures ChromaDB to use the project's defined embedding model, enhancing consistency and reliability.

*   **Embedding Lifecycle Management**:
    *   Embeddings are now automatically removed from the vector store when their corresponding items (currently Decisions and System Patterns) are deleted from Engrams, keeping the search index synchronized.

These updates significantly enhance the ability to find relevant information within your Engrams workspace and lay the groundwork for more advanced contextual understanding features.
